A Node Addon API for the raspberry pi to communcate with the PCA9685 16-bit servo driver board, however... it also handles ramping over a duration which allows for smooth movement of servos without doing loops in nodejs [loop is handled within c++ on another thread and is there for not blocking or costly].
